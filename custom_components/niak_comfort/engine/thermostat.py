"""Versatile Thermostat, recognised by itself: the extension that lets the heating speak for itself.

Any climate entity gives its mode and, often, what it is doing. A Versatile Thermostat says much more, and Hestia reads
it when the room's heating is one (its platform, never its name):

- its set point, which can stand as the room's minimum: the person chose it there, and a room at 18 °C in eco at
  17 °C is not « too cool ». Frost protection is a safeguard, not a comfort: its set point (7 °C, or 14 °C for a stove
  kept low) never stands as the minimum, the comfort temperature does;
- why it is off (by hand, an open window it detected, its own start-stop, a central mode, a power cut-off…): only
  an « off by hand » is the person's to undo, the others resume by themselves;
- its preset (eco, frost protection, away): the heating runs, aiming lower on purpose;
- the slope of the room's temperature, in °C per hour, for a room whose twin has not learned yet;
- the presence or motion it follows, for a room without a presence sensor of its own;
- the window it saw open, said to the person when no contact of the room says it.

Versatile Thermostat 7 and later group these attributes (`specific_states`, `preset_temperatures`, `window_manager`…);
earlier versions kept them flat. Both are read. Hestia still commands nothing.
