"""The room's twin: a few numbers, learned from its own measures, that say how it follows the weather.

Every half hour of the past is one sample: the indoor temperature and water content, the outdoor ones,
the sun on the station, how long a window stood open and how long the heating ran. Two small models are
fitted on them, pulled toward an ordinary room while little is known:

- temperature: ΔTi = a·(Te−Ti) + b·sun + c·heating + d·open·(Te−Ti) + f·far·(Te−Ti) + x·(Tb−Ti) + e
- water:       ΔW  = n·(We−W) + m·open·(We−W) + k·far·(We−W) + y·(Wb−W) + g

`a` gives the room's inertia, `b` what the sun brings, `d` what an open window adds, `e` the steady
gains of the household, `n` the air that leaks in with every window shut, `g` the water the room makes.
`far` is the share of the half hour when only the windows of a room sharing this air stood open (the living room's,
for the kitchen): `f` and `k` say how much less, or more, they reach this room's sensor than its own windows.
`Tb` and `Wb` are the temperature and water of that other room, as measured there: `x` and `y` say how fast the two
airs mix. Each room keeps its own measures; what the other one weighs here is learned, never set by hand.
The twin only observes: nothing here decides an advice.
