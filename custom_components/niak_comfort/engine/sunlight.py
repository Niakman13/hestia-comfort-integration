"""The sun the station cannot see: where its sensor is shaded, learned from its own history.

A station set against a wall loses the sun at some hours, every sunny day (21 October 2026: Frank's station,
on the east side, falls to a quarter of its measure each afternoon from 16 h, when the sun passes west of the
house). The windows facing that way would be told there is no sun. So, from the station's last days:

- each measure is compared with the clear-sky sun at that moment;
- on the sunny days, the directions of the sun (by 10° of azimuth) where the station keeps less than half of its
  usual share are « shaded »;
- there, the sun is estimated: the clear-sky sun, on the station's scale, times what the sky lets through: the cloud
  cover Niak Weather forecasts for the hour, set right by how far it was from the station's own measure while in the
  open (the coordinator keeps that gap); without a forecast, the share measured just before the shade.

Nothing is set by hand: a station in the open is never found shaded, and nothing changes for it.
