"""The comfort review: months of hourly measures graded on the categories of EN 16798-1.

Each hour of a room falls in a category of the European standard on indoor environment, for its warmth, its
humidity and its air; it earns 100 points in category I (high expectation), 75 in II (normal), 50 in III
(moderate), none beyond. A theme's score is the mean of its hours, 0 to 100, and a letter from A to E. A room is
graded on the themes it measures, the home on the mean of its rooms. The categories come from the standard; the
points and the letter thresholds are Hestia's own.

- warmth, heating season (November to April): fixed ranges for dwellings, 21-25 °C (I), 20-25 (II), 18-25 (III);
- warmth, otherwise: the adaptive model for rooms without cooling, around 0.33·Trm + 18.8 °C, Trm being the running
  mean of the outdoor daily means; it is used while Trm lies between 10 and 30 °C, the fixed ranges outside;
- humidity: 30-50 % (I), 25-60 (II), 20-70 (III);
- air: CO₂ above the outdoor air (taken as 400 ppm), up to 550 ppm (I), 800 (II), 1 350 (III).

An unheated room (a laundry) is not graded on its warmth. A theme with less than two weeks of measures is not graded.

Advice (`advice`) speaks only of a lasting problem the measures show, never of a cause they cannot prove: the standard's
normal range is missed half the winter in most homes heated to the legal 19 °C, so a room is told to heat only when it
falls out of every category (under 18 °C) for a sixth of the heating season, and to dry only above the 70 % that
Confort already calls a mould risk.
