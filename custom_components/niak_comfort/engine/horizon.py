"""« Prochaines heures »: the room over the coming hours, without the advised gesture and with it.

The card draws it under the advice. One room, one twin (engine/twin.py), the Niak Weather forecast; what is compared
follows the advice of the moment:

- « cool »: a hot room, summer nights. Shut against opened by NADIR's rule (engine/night.py): when to open, the
  coolness left for tomorrow's peak, the sunny hours to keep shut;
- « air »: an airing asked while it is cold outside. What the room loses, and when it is back, thanks to its walls;
- « sun »: a cool room the sun will warm by itself. Only the forecast curve: no gesture, a reason not to heat;
- « dry »: a damp room. The humidity without airing and with the airing advised, now or at the better moment.

Two subjects at most: the temperature (one kind at a time, the season decides) and the humidity. The first one is the
banner's. Everything is an estimate, drawn to show a trend, not a decimal.

Each subject says whether it is `needed`: what the gesture changes must be seen on the drawing. Shown from SHOW, kept
down to KEEP while the advice stays the same, so that a graph does not come and go on a few hundredths. A « trend »
(the room's temperature without doing anything) always comes last, never needed: for a card that keeps its graph.
The sun is needed only when the advice is about heating; otherwise it is the forecast such a card shows first.
