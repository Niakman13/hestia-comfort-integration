"""« Lumières »: the one thing Hestia Confort commands. A coloured light chosen in the hub takes the advice's colour.

The person chose the light, when it may act (already on, or woken for a gesture or an alert; never at night; only when
someone is home) and its look for each state. What the light was before Hestia changed it is kept, and put back when the
advice calms down or a safeguard stops it. A light switched off by hand is left alone until the advice changes.
A WLED segment is a light of its own; when the strip has several, its main light is turned on with it, and put back."""
