"""The integration's former technical name, gathered here and nowhere else.

Hestia Confort was first published under another technical name. A home installed then keeps that name in its
configuration entries, .storage files (learning, twins, answers, the home's settings), dashboards and automations:
domain_migration.py carries all of it over to « hestia_comfort » at the first start, then removes the old entries.
These constants are only what it needs to find them, and what lets Hestia Confort keep its link with a Hestia Weather
not updated yet. No other module writes an old name.
